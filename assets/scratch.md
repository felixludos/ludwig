You will pass the office area on your right. Go into the hallway with the painting of a feather in front of you. At the feather, turn right and take three steps toward the purple wall. You'll go into the room with the purple wall. Whenever you turn left into this room, you will see a vanity underneath the window. Step up to that vanity and you're done.",

At the crest of a stone descent known as the Top of Small Pit, the explorer stood, gazing into the depths where white mist whispered secrets from below. A pathway to the west was blocked save for a narrow crack that beckoned the daring. Rough steps carved from the ancient rock led downward, inviting further exploration.\n\nWith a steadying breath, the explorer descended the steps into the expansive Hall of Mists. The hall stretched endlessly to the west, its boundaries obscured by swirling, ghost-like mists. Openings flanked either side of the hall, while a wide stone staircase spiraled downward, the source of a chilling wind that stirred the mist into eerie dances. Behind, a passage climbed into the darkness of a domed chamber.\n\nIn the midst of exploration, the explorer noticed their score had increased by twenty-five points, a silent acknowledgment of their progress.\n\nMoving forward, they stumbled upon the Low Room. The room, humble and confining, held a crude note on the wall, a warning or perhaps a challenge: \"You won't get it up the steps.\" More intriguing, however, was the large, sparkling gold nugget that lay temptingly on the ground. With a quick motion, the explorer secured the nugget, and their score increased by seven points.\n\nReturning to the Hall of Mists, the explorer retraced their steps, the familiar cold wind greeting them like an old adversary.\n\nTheir path then led to the formidable Hall of the Mountain King. Here, passages diverged in all directions, creating a labyrinthine network of choices. Guarding one such passage was a huge green fierce snake, its presence menacing and unyielding. In a moment of inspiration, the explorer released a bird from its cage. The bird, small but fierce, launched itself at the snake. In a blur of feathers and scales, it drove the fearsome reptile away. The explorer swiftly recaptured the bird in its wicker cage, grateful for its unexpected bravery.\n\nVenturing into the Low N/S Passage, the explorer discovered silver bars gleaming in the dim light. After dropping their keys to lighten their load, they swiftly claimed the treasure, boosting their score further by seven points.\n\nAt the mysterious location marked \"Y2,\" standing in a large room adorned with a passage to the south and west and a broken eastern rock wall, the explorer uttered a mystical command, \"Plugh.\" Suddenly, they found themselves inside a building, a well house for a large spring. Here, they decided to secure their newfound treasures, depositing the silver and gold nugget, each action increasing their score by five points. The cage and some food were also set aside, lightening their burden.\n\nUttering \"Plugh\" once more transported the explorer back to the enigmatic \"Y2.\" They resumed their journey, traversing the Low N/S Passage and returning to the Hall of the Mountain King, where countless paths awaited their choice.\n\nTheir adventure continued as they ventured into the Secret E/W Canyon. Suspended over a tight canyon fifteen feet below, the path presented a precarious choice: to descend might mean no return. The explorer paused, weighing their next move in the shadowed silence of the canyon.
