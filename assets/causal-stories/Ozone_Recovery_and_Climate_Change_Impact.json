To explore this further, we could look at historical temperature records, greenhouse gas levels, and ozone layer measurements over the past few decades. By comparing these data before and after the ban, we might see how significantly this action contributed to slowing down climate change."}, "nodes": [{"name": "Environmental Policies", "description":
