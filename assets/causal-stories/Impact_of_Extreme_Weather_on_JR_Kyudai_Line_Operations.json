{"seed": 3370982, "spark": "Title: JR Kyudai Line fully opened, damaged by heavy rain, railway bridges in other sections reused (Asahi Shimbun Digital) - Yahoo! News - Yahoo! News\nDescription: The JR Kyudai Line, which had been suspended due to heavy rain damage in July last year, resumed operations from the first train on the 1st between Bungomori (Kusu Town, Oita Prefecture) and Yufuin (Yufu City, Oita Prefecture), and the entire line is now open to traffic. Restoration efforts on the Hitahikoyama Line, which was damaged by heavy rains in 2017, have been abandoned.\nOriginal Language: Japanese", "motivation": {"introduction": "The recent reopening of the JR Kyudai Line, previously halted by heavy rain damage, presents an interesting opportunity to explore the relationship between extreme weather events and public transportation systems. By examining data on the frequency and severity of such weather events, along with the operational records of the railway, we could gain insights into how weather impacts rail travel, specifically looking at delays, cancellations, and restoration efforts.", "title": "Impact_of_Extreme_Weather_on_JR_Kyudai_Line_Operations"}, "nodes": [{"name": "Regional Climate", "description": "Climatic
