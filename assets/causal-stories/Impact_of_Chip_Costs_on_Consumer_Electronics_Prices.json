{"seed": 2297226, "spark": "Title: Semiconductor giant TSMC ended the discount: Phone prices may increase - DonanimHaber\nDescription: TSMC, one of the world's leading chip manufacturers, has decided to end the discount it offers to its customers who place high-volume orders. The prices of many technological products may increase.\nOriginal Language: Turkish", "motivation": {"introduction": "With TSMC, a major chip maker, ending discounts on large orders, it's likely that the prices of phones and other tech gadgets could go up. To understand this better, we could look at past pricing data of similar products, tracking how changes in manufacturing costs have impacted retail prices. This would help us predict how much more consumers might have to pay for their next smartphone or tablet.", "title": "Impact_of_Chip_Costs_on_Consumer_Electronics_Prices"}, "nodes": [{"name":
