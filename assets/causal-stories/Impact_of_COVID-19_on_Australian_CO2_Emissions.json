What if we look at the monthly CO2 emission data from various sectors like transportation, industry, and domestic usage, before and during the pandemic? By comparing these figures, we can get a clearer picture of how different aspects of life contributed to this significant environmental shift."}, "nodes": [{"name": "Economic_Activity", "description":
