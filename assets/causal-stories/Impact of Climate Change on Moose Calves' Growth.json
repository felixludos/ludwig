By examining data from Sweden's University of Agriculture in Ume\u00e5, which includes measurements like the weight and survival rates of moose calves over several years, along with corresponding spring temperature and precipitation records, we aim to understand how climate variations are affecting these animals. The focus is on discovering trends in the calves' size and survival in relation to the changing weather patterns."}, "nodes": [{"name": "Habitat Quality", "description": "Overall quality of the
