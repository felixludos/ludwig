Five questions\u2026\nOriginal Language: Dutch", "motivation": {"introduction": "With the new policy on small plastic bottles coming into effect, it's interesting to think about how this might change our recycling habits. We could track the number of small bottles returned for a deposit over the next six months at several local supermarkets. This would give us an idea of whether the 15 cent deposit is encouraging more people to recycle and how quickly the old bottles are disappearing from circulation.", "title":
