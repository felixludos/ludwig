Here is the curious date - EMLAK 365\nDescription: A new statement came from NASA about the meteorite approaching the Earth. He said that the meteorite, which is 822 meters in size, is approaching the earth. He stated that the giant meteorite reached the world on November 29.

By gathering data on its size, speed, and trajectory over the past months, we could create a vivid picture of its path.
