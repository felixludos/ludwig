{"seed": 1970173, "spark": "Title: How much feedback is required to make Gogoro \"very obedient\"? Hands-on play with the active speed limit assist system for smart trams - Computer King Ada\nDescription: Regarding the proposition of smart security, each brand obviously has its own unique perspective. Hongjiateng wants to more fully support the iRSU smart roadside safety warning system that the government may promote in the future. Through CROXERA instrument display and voice functions, riders can predict possible dangers at the next intersection in advance. Gogoro, which has just launched the rainy day mode in the iQ System 6.0 update, expressed their new imagination for smart tram safety functions at this electric motorcycle technology forum organized by the Information Policy Council and the Taiwan Automotive Industry Association. Continue reading How much reward are you willing to give Gogoro to behave? The text of the hands-on report on the smart tram active speed limit assist system.\nOriginal Language: Chinese", "motivation": {"introduction": "Have you ever wondered how effective the new active speed limit assist system in smart trams like Gogoro really is? Let's take a closer look by examining data from various rides, tracking how often and under what circumstances the system activates. We could also compare the frequency of warnings and adjustments it makes in different environments, such as busy city intersections versus quieter suburban roads.", "title":
