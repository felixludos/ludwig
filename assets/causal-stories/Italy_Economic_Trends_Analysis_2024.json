To understand these shifts better, we could dive into recent economic data. We'll look at Italy's quarterly GDP reports, debt figures, and sector-specific growth rates, particularly focusing on industrial production and services. By comparing these data over the last few years, we can see how the pandemic has uniquely impacted different areas of the economy and what that means for future financial stability.", "title":
