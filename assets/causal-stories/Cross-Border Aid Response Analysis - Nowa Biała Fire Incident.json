By examining the time taken from the offer of aid to its deployment, and the scale of resources provided, we can gain insights into the efficiency of cross-border assistance in emergency situations. This would involve tracking the timeline of events, types and amounts of aid offered, and comparing them with similar past incidents."}, "nodes": [{"name": "Scale of Fire Damage", "description":
