Your implementation should consist of a single python function `expand` which given the state of the game (specify what state representation should be used), it will return a list of all possible next states. Make sure the states can be compared with the equals operator (i.e. `x == y` implies `x` and `y` represent the same state). Crucially, the function `expand` should only take one input representing the current state, and output a list of states each of which could be passed into `expand` without error. Return an empty list if there are no possible next states. Any helper functions should be defined before the `expand` function.
