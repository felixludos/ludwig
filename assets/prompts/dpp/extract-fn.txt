{c_task}
The overall goal is to answer this question:
{c_query} However, for now, you should only implement a very specific python function called ‘evaluate’ that to help you answer the question. This ‘evaluate’ function should take a sequence of states (as a list) as input where each state has this specification:
{desc X} The "evaluate" function should return either None, if the sequence of states is not useful for answering the question, for example, because it is irrelevant. Otherwise, if some aspect of the trajectory is useful for answering the question, then ‘evaluate’ should analyze the trajectory and extract that information and return it in a readily interpretable message. Note that the sequence of states is always ordered from a initial state to the current state being considered by the search algorithm. If None is returned the search continues trying to expand the trajectory further, otherwise the search terminates and the extracted information is used to answer the question. Since multiple rollouts may terminate with a message, make sure only to return a message if it is relevant to the question being asked, otherwise let the search continue. However, the search will only return this extracted information, so if any part of the trajectory contains useful info, be sure to include that.
