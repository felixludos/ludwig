To make the search more efficient, we may need a heuristic `evaluate` function.

This function's goal is to guide the search by prioritizing more promising states to solve the problem.

First, state whether a heuristic is necessary for this task.
- If not, explain why (e.g., the search space is small enough).
- If it is, explain your chosen approach (e.g., scoring individual states, or sorting a list of candidates) and implement the `evaluate` function.

The two possible approaches are:
1. **Score-based**: The function takes a single state and returns a score indicating its desirability. States with higher scores are considered and expanded first.
2. **Comparison-based**: The function takes a list of states and sorts them in which the most promising states come first. The search will then expand states in this order.

Provide your reasoning and, if applicable, the Python implementation inside a ```python ... ``` block. If you need helper functions, make sure they are defined within the same block so the block can stand alone.
