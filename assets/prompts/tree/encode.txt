Your task is to perform auto-formalization to help solve the following task:
{task}

You will be given a problem instance description and the JSON schema that defines its formal state representation. You must convert the natural language description into a single JSON object that strictly adheres to the schema.

---

**State Representation Schema:**
This is the target structure for the output. Pay close attention to property names, data types (`string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`), and required fields and descriptions of what information each field should contain.

```json
{json.dumps(schema, indent=2)}
```

-----

**Problem Instance:**
This is the unstructured input you must formalize. The input may contain a question, context, and other relevant details that need to be distilled into the schema. You should NOT try to answer the question directly, but rather extract the necessary information to create a valid state representation.

```text
{observation}
```

-----

**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze:** Carefully read the "Problem Instance".
2.  **Map:** Identify and extract every piece of information relevant to the state representation.
3.  **Formalize:** Construct a single JSON object that represents the initial state of the problem.
      * **Completeness:** Ensure every relevant detail from the instance is captured in the corresponding schema field.
      * **Accuracy:** Ensure all values are correct and use the exact data types specified in the schema.
      * **Exclusivity:** Omit any details from the original description that are irrelevant to the state as defined by the schema or the task.
4.  **Output:** Respond only with the final, valid JSON object. Do not include any other text or explanation.
