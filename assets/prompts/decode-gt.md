Implement a python function that is given a state representation following the JSON schema defined by **INPUT** and converts it into a state representation as described by **OUTPUT**. Call the function `decode`. Be careful to match the desired **OUTPUT** format exactly (even small details like capitalization matter).

**INPUT** schema:
```json
{schema}
```

Example **INPUT**:
```json
{state}
```

**OUTPUT**:

{desc}

Example output state:
```
{example}
```
