I would like to recommend some additional {products} to a specific user. Here's the information I have about the user:

{context}

Here are the suggested {products} that are now shown to the user:
{options}

Based on all the information provided, how likely is it that the user will select each {product}? Note, that the user may select between 2-6 of the suggested {products}, but the chance of selecting each {product} should be independent of the number of {products} selected.
Answer only with a JSON object with the following schema:
```json
{
    "title": "User Selection Likelihood List",
    "description": "A list of 12 options, each with an index and a 5-point Likert scale likelihood of the user selecting it.",
    "type": "array",
    "minItems": 12,
    "maxItems": 12,
    "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Selection Likelihood",
    "description": "An object representing a single suggestion's index and the likelihood of it being selected.",
    "properties": {
        "index": {
            "description": "The unique integer identifier for the suggestion from the question.",
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "likelihood": {
            "description": "The likelihood that the user will select the suggestion corresponding to the index, based on a 5-point Likert scale.",
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["Very unlikely", "Somewhat unlikely", "Neutral", "Somewhat likely", "Very likely"]
        }
    },
    "required": ["index", "likelihood"],
    "additionalProperties": false
    }
}
```
