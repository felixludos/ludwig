# Current task

Your task is to formalize a specific problem using a specific representation given as a JSON schema to make progress towards the overall goal.

# Problem specification

```
{question}
```

# Desired Schema

You must formalize the specific problem above into the structured JSON schema below:

```json
{json.dumps(schema, indent=2)}
```

Output the formalized problem as a JSON object that strictly adheres to the schema above. Pay close attention to the original problem specification to make sure every detail is faithfully captured in the formalization. Only formalize the problem, don't try to solve it yet.
