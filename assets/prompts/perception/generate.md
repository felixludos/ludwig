Your task is to create {N} distinct but fundamentally equivalent variations of the "Original Problem" provided below.

### The Golden Rule: Preserve the Core Logic

This is the most important instruction: **All variations must be perfectly semantically and logically equivalent to the original.**

-   **Identical Solution:** Anyone solving the original problem and any of your variations must arrive at the same answer.
-   **Identical Information:** All the critical data, numbers, relationships, and constraints must be present even if they are described differently.
-   **No Ambiguity:** Your rephrasing must not introduce any ambiguity or change the interpretation of the problem's conditions.

### What to Change (Creative Levers ðŸŽ¨)

You should be highly creative in altering the "surface" of the problem. You can change:
-   **The Narrative:** Re-skin the problem with a completely different theme or story.
-   **The Format:** Present the information in a completely new way (e.g., write out a verbose description, describe a sequence of actions and background context, or include a graphical representation to communicate the problem).
-   **The Wording & Tone:** Alter the style of language or even the use of emojis, metaphors, or analogies to convey the same information.
-   **State Representation:** Change how the problem is represented, such as using a table, a list, a graphical view, or a different structure, while keeping the underlying content the same.

### What to Preserve (The Inviolable Core ðŸ’Ž)

You **must not** change the fundamental "bones" of the problem. This includes:
-   **Quantitative Values:** All numbers, counts, percentages, and figures must remain identical.
-   **Logical Operators:** Words like "at least," "less than," "exactly," "not," "and," "or," "if/then," must be preserved with perfect fidelity. For example, "more than 5" is not the same as "at least 6."
-   **Relationships & Constraints:** The precise connections and rules between the elements must be maintained. If A depends on B, the new A must depend on the new B in the same way.
-   **The Core Question:** The final question being asked must be functionally identical.

In particular, make sure not to change any information that is critical for solving this type of specific task:

### Original Problem:

```text
{example['question']}
```

### Your Task:

Generate **{N}** creative variations of the "Original Problem" above. Follow the Golden Rule precisely. Present your output as a series of exactly {N} markdown text code blocks, each containing one independent variation. 

IMPORTANT: If you would like to include a code block within a variation, use triple quotes (""") instead of backticks to avoid formatting issues.
