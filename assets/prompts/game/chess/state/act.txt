It's your turn in a game of Chess. You playing as "{state['active']}". Here is current board state FEN:
{state['fen']}

You can take any of the following actions:
{state['options']}

Consider your options carefully and end your response with the FEN string representing the board state after your move. Make sure the last line of your response is a valid FEN string and nothing else. Make sure that in the resulting FEN string, the active player is "{'white' if state['active'] == 'black' else 'black'}", since "{state['active']}" just made a move.
