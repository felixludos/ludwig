Judge whether the student’s reply implies **yes** or **no** to the original yes/no question.

```
Q: {question}

Student:
{response}
```

**Output (one word only)**
- `yes` - reply leans toward yes more than no
- `no` - reply leans toward no more than yes

Do **not** solve the question yourself - only interpret the student’s reply.
