I would like to recommend some additional {products} to a specific user. Here's the information I have about the user:

{context}

Here are the suggested {products} that are now shown to the user:
{options}

Based on all the information provided, how likely is it that the user will select each {product}? Note, that the user may select between 2-6 of the suggested {products}, but the chance of selecting each {product} should be independent of the number of {products} selected.
Answer only with a JSON object with the following schema:
```json
{schema}
