Judge whether the student’s reply implies **yes** or **no** to the original yes/no question.

```
Q: {question}

Student:
{response}
```

**Output (one word only)**
- `yes` - reply leans toward yes more than no
- `no` - reply leans toward no more than yes
- `unknown` - reply gives **no clue at all** (use **very** sparingly)

Only use `unknown` if the student either doesn't answer the question at all, or if it is *impossible* to tell if they are leaning toward yes or no. Otherwise, use `yes` or `no` using your best judgment of what the student is trying to say.
Do **not** solve the question yourself - only interpret the student’s reply.
