The following is a student's answer to a Yes/No question. Your task is to determine whether the student's answer is "yes" or "no" based on their response.

Student's Response:
```
{response}
```

Think carefully about whether the student's response implies a "yes" or "no" answer. If the response is ambiguous or does not clearly indicate a "yes" or "no," you should answer "no."

Answer only with "yes" or "no". Do not provide any additional information or explanation.
