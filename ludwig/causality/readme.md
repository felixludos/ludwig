## Description of the causal tasks

For the symbolic causal tasks, we coded a child class of TaskBase called CausalTask. CausalTask implements the method `_generate_dag`, which returns a tuple (causal\_pairs, nx\_graph). 

"Causal pairs" is a list of tuples, where the first element of the tuple is a cause and the second is the effect. We use this to generate natural language descriptions of the causal graphs for the LLM.

"Nx graph" is a DAG (DiGraph) in the package networkx to use some of the operations available to us for causal graphs.

### There are currently 3 tasks all requiring a yes or no answer:

- is\_ancestor: the problem returned by the method generate consists of an ancestor pair (variable\_i, potential\_ancestor\_of\_i), and a set of causal relations as generated by \_generate\_dag. The LLM should answer yes or no to whether potential\_ancestor\_of\_i is an ancestor of variable\_i.
- is\_graph\_connected: the problem returned by the method generate consists of only the causal pairs. The LLM should answer whether the graph is connected (there are no separated subgraphs) given a set of causal pairs.
- is\_backdoor\_adjustment: the problem returned by method generatte consists of a tuple ((variable\_j, variable\_i, adjustment\_set), causal\_pairs). The LLM should answer whether adjustment\_set is a d-separating set between varialbe\_i and variable\_j. [TODO: consider changing the name of the task to d-separates instead].
